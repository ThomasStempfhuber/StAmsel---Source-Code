Bastian Roth: You’re the one staying at the inn, yeah? Figured. Most visitors end up walking the lake path sooner or later.
Bastian Roth: It’s a nice view, sure — just don’t go swimming in it.
=> questions1

~ questions1
- You cut wood for the village?
	Bastian Roth: Firewood, mostly. Matthias needs a lot this time of year. => questions1
- Why shouldn’t you swim in the lake?
	Bastian Roth: Looks calm, but there’s pull underneath. You don’t feel it ‘til it’s too late. No one really knows how deep the Bruchsee goes. Folks around here stay out of it.
	Bastian Roth: Well... most do. => questions2
- Are going to the morning mass tomorrow?
	Bastian Roth: Wouldn’t miss it. Whole village will be there. => questions1
- What is in that locked shack? [if Global.tried_shack == true]
	Bastian Roth: Only old diving gear. => questions1
- The pfarrer mentioned a new bell. [if Global.note_diving_helper == true]
	Bastian Roth: Bell’s not new. Just cleaned up. The clapper’s what’s new. => questions1
- I heard the Pfarrer goes diving in the lake [if Global.note_diving == true]
	Bastian Roth: Every week. => questions1
- You help the Pfarrer dive? [if Global.note_diving_helper == true]
	Bastian Roth: ... I handle the gear. Air line, pressure, that sort of thing. 
	Bastian Roth: He goes down alone. Doesn’t say much about what he’s looking for. => questionsDiving
- Take care.

~ questions2
- Most?
	Bastian Roth: Doesn’t matter. You’re not planning to go in, are you? => questions1

~ questionsDiving
- And you are not asking why he ?
	Bastian Roth: Not my place to ask. He’s the Pfarrer. => questionsDiving
- How deep does he go?
	Bastian Roth: Deeper than I’d be comfortable with. Sometimes I don’t hear a thing for ten, fifteen minutes. => questionsDiving
- Do you see what he brings up?
	Bastian Roth: Most times, nothing.
	Bastian Roth: But he came back one Sunday with something. Didn’t show it. Just went straight to the church. => questionsClapper

~ questionsClapper
- Hmm, can I see the diving gear? 
	Bastian Roth: No. Pfarrer doesn’t let anyone else in the shack. Not since he started going deeper. => questionsGear

~ questionsGear
- It’s not just curiosity. Something’s off.
	do Global.start_Dusk()
	Bastian Roth: You’re not the first to notice ... I’ll leave the shack open tonight.
