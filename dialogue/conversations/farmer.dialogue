	Helga Kober: Ah, the Bruchsee — it’s just east of here, past the trees.
	Helga Kober: Deep and clear, even when the rest of the valley’s still frozen it remains unchanged. Some say it doesn’t have a bottom. => questions1
- There’s a festival tomorrow?
	Helga Kober: We gather at the church before sunrise, then head to the Wirtshaus afterwards. => questions1
